        On behalf of WHO, Dr. Balwinder Chawla, Health Cluster Coordinator, emphasized that “The key to effective clinical management of dengue is early recognition and understanding of the clinical signs during the different phases of the disease. Last month we advised all our partners to remain vigilant and use the WHO early warning alert and response system (EWARS). Today we thank you all - doctors, nurses and paramedics here present - for being at the forefront of early detection and sound clinical management”.
        During the training, the participants learned that there is no specific treatment for dengue fever, however, there are specific guidelines to manage dengue fever patients according to their symptoms, age and co-existing conditions (including diabetes, pregnancy, hypertension, etc.) or risk factors that may need careful monitoring and hospitalization.

        As the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, dengue inflicts a significant health, economic and social burden on the populations of endemic areas. The virus affects all levels of society but has a higher impact among those living in communities with inadequate water supply and solid waste management, and where conditions are most favorable for multiplication of the main vector, Aedes aegypti.
        With more 260 doctors trained in dengue clinical case management in Cox’s Bazar district, WHO expects to improve early detection and appropriate clinical management of dengue infected patients. However, further efforts are required to identify and destroy mosquito breeding sites at household, community and health facility levels. The current priority is prevention through clean-up initiatives and self-care to mitigate exposure to mosquito bites.
