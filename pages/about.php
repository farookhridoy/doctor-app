			On behalf of WHO, Dr. Balwinder Chawla, Health Cluster Coordinator, emphasized that “The key to effective clinical management of dengue is early recognition and understanding of the clinical signs during the different phases of the disease. Last month we advised all our partners to remain vigilant and use the WHO early warning alert and response system (EWARS). Today we thank you all - doctors, nurses and paramedics here present - for being at the forefront of early detection and sound clinical management”. During the training, the participants learned that there is no specific treatment for dengue fever, however, there are specific guidelines to manage dengue fever patients according to their symptoms, age and co-existing conditions (including diabetes, pregnancy, hypertension, etc.) or risk factors that may need careful monitoring and hospitalization.
